\chapter{Implementation}\label{chapter:implementation}

%The main purpose of the thesis is to use weakly acyclic languages to address the coverability problem in Petri nets. Therefore, the concepts from \autoref{chapter:weakly_acyclic_language} are used to adapt the Backwards Reachability Algorithm in Algorithm \autoref{alg:bw}.
\par
%The Algorithm \autoref{alg:bw} is working with infinite upward-closed sets of markings, like $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{old}$. Since automata are characterizing languages, which are a set of words, they are a way to describe these infinite sets in a compact finite representation. In fact, for the representation of the upward closed markings, the subset of weakly acyclic languages are sufficient.
\par
%Therefore, the idea is to represent each of the upward-closed sets, which are used in Algorithm \autoref{alg:bw}, by a weakly acyclic DFA. To manage all those DFAs efficiently, a data structure $table$ is introduced. The $table$ stores a set of weakly acyclic DFAs using the concept of the master automaton in \autoref{chapter:weakly_acyclic_language}. It further provides the required set operations $union$ and $intersection$, which calculate the union/intersection of two weakly acyclic languages. Furthermore, there are encoding functions, which take a marking, convert it into a weakly acyclic DFA, and adds it to the $table$.
\par
%For the main operation $pre$, to calculate all possible predecessor markings, the structure of the petri net $N$ comes into use. 


%The given input are the petri net $N$, a start marking $M_{0}$ and an end marking $M$ analogous to Algorithm \autoref{alg:bw}. 
%This Algorithm \autoref{alg:bw_wwa} adds a $table$ data structure, which is representing a set of weakly acyclic automata. Those weakly acyclic languages are corresponding to upward closed sets of markings.
%The $table$ is providing most of the important functions, like $union$ and $pre$. 
%Furthermore, there is $transducer$, a data structure representing one weakly acyclic transducer. With the function $net2transducer$, the information about the flow relation of the transitions in petri net $N$ are given to $transducer$.
