\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}


\begin{itemize}
\item we implemented a tool for solving bw problem in petri nets 
\item designed appropiate 
\item could proof the correctness by comparing the minimal elements
\item results were competitive with other state of the art tools, especially for smaller 
\item compact representation of the resulting set of predecessor markings 
\end{itemize}



future todos 
\begin{itemize}
\item profiling and optimizing : we performed test with c++ compiler
\item garbage collection for the table : padded nodes not relevant
\end{itemize}
