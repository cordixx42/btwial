\section{Petri Nets}
A petri net is tuple $(S,T,F,M_{0})$ where 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $S$ is a finite set of places 
	\item $T$ is a finite set of transitions disjoint from $S$
	\item $F \subseteq (S \times T) \cup (T \times S)$ is a flow relation 
	\item $M_{0}: S $ is an initial marking 
	% connected net def ? 
\end{itemize}
\
A marking of a net is a mapping $M : S -> nat$, assigning each place a number of tokens. We represent these markings by using vectors. We fix a total order on the places of the net
