\chapter{Weakly Acyclic Languages}\label{chapter:weakly_acyclic_language}

In this chapter we introduce a class of formal languages, which we call weakly acyclic. They are a subset of the regular languages and are characterized by having no cycles beyond self-loops in the automata representation.

\section{Weakly Acyclic DFAs}\label{sec:weakly_acyclic_dfa}

\begin{definition}[\cite{blondin_24}]
Let $A = (Q, \Sigma, q_{0},\delta,F)$ be a DFA and let $\alpha(w)$ be the set of letter, which occur within in word $w$. DFA $A$ is weakly acyclic, if $\delta(q,w) = q$ implies $\delta(q,a) = q$ for every $a \in \alpha(w)$
\end{definition}

The following definitions are equivalently expressing, that a DFA $(Q, \Sigma, q_{0},\delta,F)$ is \textit{weakly acyclic}:
\begin{itemize}[--,noitemsep]
	\item the binary relation $\precsim $  over $Q \times Q$ with $q \precsim q'$ if $\delta(q,w) = q'$ is a partial order
	\item each strongly connected component of underlying directed graph contains a single state 
	\item the underlying directed graph does not contain any simple cycle except from self-loops
\end{itemize}

\autoref{fig:wadfa} shows an example for a weakly acyclic DFA and \autoref{fig:notwa} illustrates two not weakly acyclic DFAs.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:minimal}
Let $A$ be a weakly acyclic DFA. The minimal DFA that accepts L$(A)$ is also weakly acyclic. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See {\cite[Proposition~4]{blondin_24}}
\end{proof}



\section{Other Representations}

As with regular languages, there are equivalent ways to represent weakly acyclic languages. Let $\alpha(w)$ be the set of letter, which occur within in word $w$. 
Blondin et al. have shown that weakly acyclic DFAs, weakly acyclic NFAs and weakly acyclic expressions represent the same class of weakly acyclic languages \cite{blondin_24}. 


%It can further be shown, that if a weakly acyclic DFA $A$ accepts the language $L(A)$, then the minimal automata for this language is also weakly acyclic \cite{blondin_24}. 

\subsection{Weakly Acyclic NFAs}
An NFA $(Q, \Sigma, q_{0},\delta,F)$ is \textit{weakly acyclic} if 
\begin{itemize}[--,noitemsep]
	\item $q \in \delta(q,w)$ implies $\delta(q,a) = {q}$ for every $a \in \alpha(w)$
	\item the underlying directed graph does not contain any simple cycle except from self-loops and non-determinism with a letter $a$ can only appear from a state with no self-loop of $a$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Weakly Acyclic Expressions}\label{sec:weakly_acyclic_regex}
The class of weakly acyclic languages can also be characterized by \textit{weakly acyclic expressions} of the following form:
\begin{equation*}
r \Coloneqq \emptyset \mid \Gamma^{*} \mid \Lambda^{*} a r \mid r + r \quad \text{where} \quad  \Gamma, \Lambda \subseteq \Sigma \quad \textrm{and} \quad a \in \Sigma \setminus \Lambda
\end{equation*}

\section{Properties}
\subsection{Position in Language Hierarchy}
Weakly acyclic languages lie strictly in between finite and regular languages, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:hierar}.
They are within the regular languages, as they can be characterized with DFAs, NFAs and regular expressions. Furthermore, every finite language is weakly acyclic, as only a self-loop in the trap state is necessary to represent a finite set of words.

\subsection{Closure Properties}
Weakly acyclic languages are closed under union, intersection and complementation, but not under concatenation or Kleene star \cite{blondin_24}. 
\par 
As weakly acyclic languages can be described by DFAs, complementing a DFA still preserves its weakly acyclic structure. Furthermore, union is already present in the definition of weakly acyclic expressions in \autoref{sec:weakly_acyclic_regex}. Therefore, this class is also closed under intersection, which can be expressed with the combination of union and complementation. 
\par
Weakly acyclic languages are not closed under concatenation. The expressions $\bm{(a + b)^{*}}$ and $\bm{b}$ are weakly acyclic by themselves. The language of their concatenation $\bm{(a + b)^{*}b}$ is depicted in its unique minimal DFA in \autoref{fig:not-closed-concat}.

By Lemma~\autoref{lem:minimal} the minimal automaton of weakly acyclic language remains weakly acyclic. As this automaton contains a cycle of length 2, this language is not weakly acyclic. The same argumentation can be made for the Kleene star closure, with $\bm{ab}$ being a weakly acyclic language but $\bm{(ab)^{*}}$ represented in \autoref{fig:not-closed-kleene} is not weakly acyclic.
