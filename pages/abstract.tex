%TODO: Abstract

The coverability problem of Petri nets plays a crucial role in analyzing and arguing about distributed and concurrent systems over various application areas, including parallel programs, biological models, or business processes. 
Nevertheless, its EXPSPACE-complete nature presents a challenge when confronted with practical scenarios. 

This thesis presents a novel approach to the coverability problem, which utilizes a class of formal language called weakly acyclic. We design a data structure for minimal weakly acyclic DFAs, this can be seen as a generalization of binary decision diagrams. Subsequently, we integrate this data structure into the Backwards Reachability Algorithm, an existing high-level procedure for solving the coverability problem. 

We perform benchmarks on real-life instances, which show that our implementation is competitive with prevailing coverability tools and that the representation with weakly acyclic languages provides a compact finite description of configurations in Petri nets.
