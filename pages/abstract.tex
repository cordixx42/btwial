%TODO: Abstract

The coverability problem of Petri nets plays a crucial role in analyzing and arguing about distributed and concurrent systems over a variety of application areas, including parallel programs, biological models or business processes. 
%The problem answers the question about the reachability of a certain configuration of the Petri net.
Nevertheless, its EXPSPACE-complete nature presents a challenge when confronted with practical scenarios. 

In this thesis, we present a novel approach on the coverability problem, which utilizes a class of formal language called weakly acyclic. We design a data structure for operating with these weakly acyclic languages and integrate it into the Backwards Reachability Algorithm, which is an existing high-level procedure for solving the coverability problem. 

We perform benchmarks on real-life instances, which show that our implementation is competitive with other prevailing coverability tools and that the representation with weakly acyclic languages provides a compact finite description of infinite sets of configurations in Petri nets.
