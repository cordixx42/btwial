abstract="The coverability problem for Petri nets plays a central role in the verification of concurrent shared-memory programs. However, its high EXPSPACE-complete complexity poses a challenge when encountered in real-world instances. In this paper, we develop a new approach to this problem which is primarily based on applying forward coverability in continuous Petri nets as a pruning criterion inside a backward-coverability framework. A cornerstone of our approach is the efficient encoding of a recently developed polynomial-time algorithm for reachability in continuous Petri nets into SMT. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard benchmarks from the literature, which shows that our approach decides significantly more instances than any existing tool and is in addition often much faster, in particular on large instances.",

In this article, we consider the automated verification of such programs where an unknown number of threads execute a given finite-data procedure in parallel. Such procedures are typically obtained as predicate abstractions of recursion-free source code written in C or Java. Many safety problems over finite-data replicated multithreaded programs are decidable via a reduction to the coverability problem in certain types of well-ordered infinite-state transition systems. On the other hand, in full generality, this problem is Ackermann-hard, which seems to rule out efficient algorithmic treatment.We present a novel, sound, and complete yet empirically efficient solution. Our approach is to judiciously widen the original set of coverability targets by configurations that involve fewer threads and are thus easier to decide, and whose exploration may well be sufficient: if they turn out uncoverable, so are the original targets. To soften the impact of “bad guesses”—configurations that turn out coverable—the exploration is accompanied by a parallel engine that generates coverable configurations; none of these is ever selected for widening. Its job being merely to prevent bad widening choices, such an engine need not be complete for coverability analysis, which enables a range of existing partial (e.g., nonterminating) techniques. We present extensive experiments on multithreaded C programs, including device driver code from FreeBSD, Solaris, and Linux distributions. Our approach outperforms existing coverability methods by orders of magnitude.}, journal = {ACM Trans. Program. Lang.

ABSTRACT = {Systems composed of many components which interact with each other and lead to unpredictable global behaviour, are considered as complex systems. In a biological context, complex systems represent living systems composed of a large number of interacting elements. In order to study these systems, a precise mathematical modelling was typically used in this context. However, this modelling has limitations in the structural understanding and the behavioural study. In this sense, formal computational modelling is an approach that allows to model and to simulate dynamical properties of these particular systems. In this paper, we use Hybrid Functional Petri Net (HFPN), a Petri net extension dedicated to study and verify biopathways, to model and study the Methionine metabolic pathway. Methionine and its derivatives play significant roles in human bodies. We propose a set of simulations for the purpose of studying and analysing the Methionine pathway’s behaviour. Our simulation results have shown that several important abnormalities in this pathway are related to sever diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease, cancers and others.},

We start with going back into the history and explain why this activity appeared and became of such importance for organizations to achieve their business targets. We discuss the context in which business process modeling takes place and give a comprehensive overview of the techniques used in modeling. We consider bottom up and top down approaches to modeling, also in the context of developing correct-by-construction models of business processes. The correctness property we focus on is soundness, or weak termination, basically meaning that at every moment of its execution, a process has an option to continue along an execution path leading to termination, which is an important sanity check for business processes. Finally, we discuss analogies between business processes and software services and their orchestrations and argue the applicability of the described modeling techniques to the world of services.",

To this end, we introduce an automated model generation scheme that builds upon a coarse description of the production process and the factory. The generated model is based on a Petri Net representation of the production process, which we slightly enhance to separate automatically evolving processes from consciously taken manufacturing decisions. From the Petri Net model we deduce a state space description which can be used for the synthesis of feedback control for the manufacturing system. The model generation is illustrated with an example and further possibilities to utilize and enhance the model are discussed.}

When applied to this class of verification problems, traditional (infinite-state) symbolic model checkers suffer from the state explosion problem even for very small examples. We provide BDD-like data structures to represent in a compact way collections of upwards closed sets over numerical domains.

abstract="Thanks to the development of a number of efficiency enhancing techniques, state-space exploration based verification, and in particular model checking, has been quite successful for finite-state systems. This has prompted efforts to apply a similar approach to systems with infinite state spaces. Doing so amounts to developing algorithms for computing a symbolic representation of the infinite state space, as opposed to requiring the user to characterize the state space by assertions. Of course, in most cases, this can only be done at the cost of forgoing any general guarantee of success. The goal of this paper is to survey a number of results in this area and to show that a surprisingly common characteristic of the systems that can be analyzed with this approach is that their state space can be represented as a regular language.",
