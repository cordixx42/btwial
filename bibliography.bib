abstract = {New decision procedures for the covering and boundedness problems for vector addition systems are obtained. These procedures require at most space 2cn log n for some constant c. The procedures nearly achieve recently established lower bounds on the amount of space inherently required to solve these problems, and so are much more efficient than previously known non-primitive-recursive decision procedures.}

abstract="The coverability problem for Petri nets plays a central role in the verification of concurrent shared-memory programs. However, its high EXPSPACE-complete complexity poses a challenge when encountered in real-world instances. In this paper, we develop a new approach to this problem which is primarily based on applying forward coverability in continuous Petri nets as a pruning criterion inside a backward-coverability framework. A cornerstone of our approach is the efficient encoding of a recently developed polynomial-time algorithm for reachability in continuous Petri nets into SMT. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard benchmarks from the literature, which shows that our approach decides significantly more instances than any existing tool and is in addition often much faster, in particular on large instances.",
